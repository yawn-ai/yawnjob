## AWAKENING

**Intent**: Generate structured FAQ Q&A pairs from any public URL.
AI reads the page content and creates the questions visitors are already asking.

**Need**: Exploration
**Verb**: Create
**Object**: FAQ section
**JTBD**: When I have a webpage without a FAQ section, I want to generate
relevant questions and answers from its content, so I can improve user
experience and reduce support burden.
