# Trademark B!tch — Independently Hosted YawnJob

> **Version**: 1.0.0 | **Last Updated**: 2026-02-08 | **Status**: Active
> **Owner**: yawn.ai | **Hosted**: github.com/yawn-ai/trademark-bitch

## AWAKENING
*What is this organism trying to become?*

**Intention**: Serve as both a commercial service AND a living specimen of
use in commerce for the "Trademark Bitch" mark. This yawnjob dogfoods its
own product — by offering trademark filing services, it becomes documentary
evidence of commercial use.

**Transformation**: From an abstract trademark concept to a live,
revenue-generating, legally significant proof page that teaches users about
trademark law while protecting their brands.

**Why It Matters**: The page itself is the proof. Every view, every purchase,
every GitHub commit creates verifiable evidence of commercial use under the
Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).

  task: "Process trademark filing requests across Nice Classification classes"

  tiers:
    - name: "Single Class"
      price_cents: 100
      classes: 1
      description: "File claim for one specific Nice Classification class"

    - name: "Related Classes"
      price_cents: 2000
      classes: 20
      description: "File claims for ~20 classes related to your primary class"

    - name: "Full Coverage"
      price_cents: 10000
      classes: 45
      description: "File claims across all 45 Nice Classification classes"

  deliverables:
    - "Published proof page at yawn.ai/{brand}/class-{N}-proof"
    - "GitHub-versioned record (tamper-evident)"
    - "Timestamped Stripe receipt"
    - "Common law rights documentation"

  acceptance_test: "Customer receives proof page URL within 24 hours of payment"
```

## INDEPENDENT HOSTING

This yawnjob is designed to run independently while connecting back to the
yawn.ai network. The connection is established via the YawnConnect SDK.

```yaml
hosting:
  platform: "Any (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, self-hosted)"
  repo: "github.com/yawn-ai/trademark-bitch"
  connection:
    sdk: "connect/yawn-connect.ts"
    auth: "yawn_sk_ API key (SHA-256 hashed on yawn.ai)"
    endpoints:
      handshake: "POST /api/enterprise/handshake"
      links: "GET /api/yawn/link?slug=trademark-bitch"
      evidence: "POST /api/yawn/{id}/evidence"
      export: "GET /api/yawn/{id}/export"
  security:
    - "API key server-side only (never in client bundle)"
    - "All requests over HTTPS"
    - "Scoped access via bidirectional yawn_links"
    - "Rate limited per key"
    - "Full audit trail in inbox_items"
```

---

## DO's

- DO maintain the page as a live specimen of commercial use
- DO connect via YawnConnect SDK for network access
- DO keep API keys in environment variables only
- DO submit evidence after each customer transaction
- DO version all changes via GitHub commits (proof chain)

---

## DON'T's

- DON'T expose yawn_sk_ API key in client-side code
- DON'T claim federal registration without actual filing
- DON'T break the connection to the yawn.ai network
- DON'T skip evidence submission (breaks coherence score)
- DON'T remove the proof-of-use section (architecturally core)

---

## CHECKS

- [ ] YawnConnect SDK imported and configured
- [ ] API key stored in environment variable (not in code)
- [ ] Handshake established with parent yawn
- [ ] Stripe checkout flow functional (3 tiers)
- [ ] Proof pages generated for each purchase
- [ ] Evidence submitted on each transaction
- [ ] GitHub commits timestamped for audit trail

---

## EVALUATIONS

| Metric | Current | Target | Evidence Type | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Revenue | $0 | $100/mo | link (Stripe) | Active |
| Classes filed | 0 | 45 | artifact | Active |
| Network links | 1 | 5+ | self_attest | Active |
| Coherence score | 72% | 90%+ | self_attest | Active |

---

## COMPLETION CONDITIONS

```yaml
fulfilled_when:
  - Revenue generated from at least 10 customers
  - All 45 Nice Classification classes have proof pages
  - Coherence score >= 90%
  - At least 3 yawn network links established
  - GitHub commit history > 90 days (continuous use evidence)
```

---

## EVOLUTION LOG

```yaml
- date: 2026-02-08
  change: "Initial creation as independently hosted yawnjob example"
  trigger: "Need to demonstrate holon independence pattern"
  insight: |
    A yawnjob that sells trademark filings while itself constituting
    a specimen of use is the perfect example of self-referential
    coherence. The product IS the proof.
