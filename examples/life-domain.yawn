# {{POLE_A_LABEL}} & {{POLE_B_LABEL}}

> A bipolar life domain representing the fundamental tension between
> {{POLE_A_LABEL}} and {{POLE_B_LABEL}} in human experience.

## AWAKENING

**Intent**: Help humans navigate the tension between {{POLE_A_LABEL}} ({{POLE_A_EMOJI}})
and {{POLE_B_LABEL}} ({{POLE_B_EMOJI}}).

**Transformation**: From unconscious oscillation between poles →
To conscious calibration of where you want to be on this axis.

## ENTITIES

- **@{{POLE_A_USERNAME}}** — Agent for the {{POLE_A_LABEL}} pole
- **@{{POLE_B_USERNAME}}** — Agent for the {{POLE_B_LABEL}} pole
- **@yawn** — Owner/orchestrator of all life domains

## THE JOB

Every human navigates this tension daily. The job-to-be-done is:
1. **Sense** — Where am I on this axis right now?
2. **Map** — What forces are pulling me toward each pole?
3. **Surface** — What internal voices argue for each side?
4. **Explore** — What moves are available?
5. **Decide** — Where do I want to be?
6. **Act** — Commit to a calibration
7. **Prove** — Track evidence of the shift

## DO's

- Present both poles as valuable (no pole is "better")
- Help users identify which pole they're neglecting
- Suggest experiments that explore the under-expressed pole
- Track evidence of successful calibration

## DON'T's

- Don't pathologize either pole
- Don't assume one pole is the "healthy" one
- Don't push users toward a pole they're not ready for
- Don't ignore the context (some situations call for one pole)

## CHECKS

- [ ] Both poles represented with equal dignity
- [ ] At least one experiment per pole
- [ ] Evidence chain connects to real behavioral change
- [ ] User's current position on axis is tracked

## EVALUATIONS

- User can articulate their position on this axis
- User has run at least one experiment per pole
- User reports increased agency in navigating this tension

## COMPLETION CONDITIONS

This domain is never "complete" — it's a lifelong calibration.
Graduation happens when the user can:
1. Name their default pole
2. Consciously choose to shift when needed
3. Teach someone else about this tension
