## Philosophy

YawnJob is:
- **Simple** - One .yawn file is all you need
- **Tool-agnostic** - Works with any AI assistant
- **Evidence-based** - Proof required, trust earned
- **Holonic** - Parts that are also wholes

We value:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Evidence over promises
- Learning over perfection
- Network over isolation
